# 712. Minimum ASCII Delete Sum for Two Strings

https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-ascii-delete-sum-for-two-strings/

Given two strings s1 and s2, return the lowest ASCII sum of deleted characters to make two strings equal.

 
Example 1:

Input: s1 = &quot;sea&quot;, s2 = &quot;eat&quot;
Output: 231
Explanation: Deleting &quot;s&quot; from &quot;sea&quot; adds the ASCII value of &quot;s&quot; (115) to the sum.
Deleting &quot;t&quot; from &quot;eat&quot; adds 116 to the sum.
At the end, both strings are equal, and 115 + 116 = 231 is the minimum sum possible to achieve this.

Example 2:

Input: s1 = &quot;delete&quot;, s2 = &quot;leet&quot;
Output: 403
Explanation: Deleting &quot;dee&quot; from &quot;delete&quot; to turn the string into &quot;let&quot;,
adds 100[d] + 101[e] + 101[e] to the sum.
Deleting &quot;e&quot; from &quot;leet&quot; adds 101[e] to the sum.
At the end, both strings are equal to &quot;let&quot;, and the answer is 100+101+101+101 = 403.
If instead we turned both strings into &quot;lee&quot; or &quot;eet&quot;, we would get answers of 433 or 417, which are higher.

 
Constraints:

	1 <= s1.length, s2.length <= 1000
	s1 and s2 consist of lowercase English letters.

```java
class Solution {
    public int minimumDeleteSum(String s1, String s2) {
        int m = s1.length(), n = s2.length();
        int[][] dp = new int[m + 1][n + 1];
        for (int i = 1; i <= m; i++) dp[i][0] = dp[i - 1][0] + s1.charAt(i - 1);
        for (int j = 1; j <= n; j++) dp[0][j] = dp[0][j - 1] + s2.charAt(j - 1);
        for (int i = 1; i <= m; i++) {
            for (int j = 1; j <= n; j++) {
                if (s1.charAt(i - 1) == s2.charAt(j - 1)) {
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1];
                } else {
                    dp[i][j] = Math.min(dp[i - 1][j] + s1.charAt(i - 1), dp[i][j - 1] + s2.charAt(j - 1));
                }
            }
        }
        return dp[m][n];
    }
}
```
